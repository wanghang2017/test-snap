### What are MetaMask Snaps?

MetaMask Snaps are like magical add-ons for MetaMask. They create a safe space where you can customize and enhance your MetaMask wallet. Snaps do this by adding new features or tweaking existing ones, all within a controlled environment.
For more about MetaMask Snaps, check out [this detailed guide](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/).
